This Repo is a storage of the files and information I'm collecting along the path of learning python

I'm using a course series on stackskills to learn python programing. I've setup GNS3 and configured a 5 router set up which is currently up and running. I've used virtual box to start up and connect to my GNS3 network and currently working through the basics of Python.
